    "Measures of dispersion, including range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how closely or widely the individual data points are distributed around the central tendency (mean, median, etc.). Let's explore these measures using an example:\n",

    "**Example: Exam Scores**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Class A: 85, 90, 92, 88, 85\n",
    "Class B: 70, 75, 85, 95, 100\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range**:\n",
    "   - The range is the simplest measure of dispersion. It's the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n",
    "   - For Class A: Range = 92 - 85 = 7\n",
    "   - For Class B: Range = 100 - 70 = 30\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Variance**:\n",
    "   - Variance measures the average squared difference between each data point and the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "   - Calculating the variance involves these steps:\n",
    "     1. Calculate the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "     2. Subtract the mean from each data point and square the result.\n",
    "     3. Calculate the average of these squared differences.\n",
    "   - Variance is sensitive to the scale of the data and its unit is squared.\n",
    "   - For Class A:\n",
    "     - Mean = (85 + 90 + 92 + 88 + 85) / 5 = 88\n",
    "     - Variance = [(85 - 88)^2 + (90 - 88)^2 + (92 - 88)^2 + (88 - 88)^2 + (85 - 88)^2] / 5 = 8.8\n",
    "   - For Class B:\n",
    "     - Mean = (70 + 75 + 85 + 95 + 100) / 5 = 85\n",
    "     - Variance = [(70 - 85)^2 + (75 - 85)^2 + (85 - 85)^2 + (95 - 85)^2 + (100 - 85)^2] / 5 = 325\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It's a more interpretable measure of dispersion.\n",
    "   - For Class A: Standard Deviation = √8.8 ≈ 2.97\n",
    "   - For Class B: Standard Deviation = √325 ≈ 18.03\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the range of Class B is wider, indicating greater variability in scores. The variance and standard deviation for Class B are also higher, reinforcing the idea of greater spread in the data. Class A has lower variance and standard deviation, indicating less variability in scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, measures of dispersion provide insights into the extent to which data points are spread out around the central tendency. Range gives a basic sense of spread, while variance and standard deviation provide more detailed information about the distribution of data points.\n",
