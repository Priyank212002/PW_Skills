    "MongoDB is a popular and widely used NoSQL (non-relational) database management system. It is designed to store and manage vast amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB stores data in a JSON-like format known as BSON (Binary JSON), which allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.\n",

    "Non-relational databases (NoSQL) differ from traditional relational databases (SQL) in the way they handle data and relationships. In short, non-relational databases do not use a fixed schema like SQL databases do. Instead, they allow for more dynamic and flexible data models, making it easier to store and manage complex, unstructured, or rapidly changing data.\n",
