    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns to perform exceptionally well on the training data but struggles to generalize to new, unseen data. Essentially, the model has learned the noise or random fluctuations in the training data rather than the underlying patterns. Consequences of overfitting include poor performance on test or validation data, high variance, and a model that is too complex for the problem. To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as reducing model complexity (e.g., using simpler algorithms or reducing the number of features), increasing the amount of training data, and using regularization methods like L1 or L2 regularization can be employed. Cross-validation can also help in identifying overfitting by assessing a model's performance on multiple subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance even on the training data. It represents a high bias problem where the model cannot represent the complexity of the problem adequately. The consequences of underfitting include low accuracy on both training and test data and a failure to learn meaningful relationships. To address underfitting, one can try increasing model complexity (e.g., using a more sophisticated algorithm or adding more features), collecting more relevant data, or adjusting hyperparameters to better suit the problem. In some cases, it may also be necessary to reevaluate the model's architecture or approach.\n",

    "The bias-variance tradeoff is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the relationship between two sources of errors in model predictions: bias and variance. It explains how model complexity influences a model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias: Bias is the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem with a simplified model. It represents the difference between the expected predictions of the model and the true values. High bias implies that the model makes strong assumptions about the data, which may not be true, leading to systematic errors. Models with high bias tend to underfit the data, performing poorly on both the training and test datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance: Variance is the error introduced due to the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations or noise in the training data. High variance means that the model is highly flexible and capable of capturing complex patterns, including noise. However, this flexibility can lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely and fails to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between bias and variance can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Bias, Low Variance: Models with high bias make strong simplifying assumptions about the data, resulting in simple, rigid models. These models tend to underfit the data, meaning they have a systematic error in their predictions. They exhibit low variance because their predictions are consistently close to each other, even when trained on different subsets of data.\n",

    "Low Bias, High Variance: Models with low bias are more flexible and capable of capturing complex patterns in the data, including noise. However, they may fit the training data too closely and perform poorly on new, unseen data. These models exhibit high variance because their predictions can vary significantly when trained on different subsets of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal in machine learning is to strike a balance between bias and variance, finding a model that generalizes well to new data without overfitting. This balance depends on the complexity of the model and the size and quality of the training dataset.\n",

    "Increasing model complexity (e.g., adding more features or layers in a neural network) tends to decrease bias but increase variance.\n",
